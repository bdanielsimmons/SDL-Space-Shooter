# SDL-Space-Shooter
My rendition of a space shooter using the sdl2 library and C++. Currently detects basic collision between lasers(shot with the spacebar) and boxes and lets you move around the left half of the screen with the arrow keys. Initially created solo a Google HackAtlanta 2016. This is v1, where the collision detector causees a memory leak.
